<p>Earlier this week, I wrote about <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/compiled/process/pinning_setuptools_and_pip_vir.html">how to make virtualenv install pip and setuptools from local source distributions</a>, instead of fetching unpinned copies of them from the Internet, which it does (somewhat silently) by default.  The approach relied on a somewhat buried feature of virtualenv: looking for appropriate distributions in a <code>virtualenv_support</code> directory before downloading them.</p><p>In a future release of virtualenv, this will be easier, and also more apparent. &nbsp;I submitted patches for two new features which were accepted by virtualenv's maintainers:</p><p></p><ul><li>An <a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/114"><code>--extra-search-dir=/path/to/directory</code> command-line argument</a>, which lets you put pip/setuptools/distribute distributions wherever you want on the filesystem.</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/117"><code>--never-download</code> flag, which will cause virtualenv.py to fail during installation</a> if local distributions aren't found, instead of downloading packages from the Internet; useful if you want to be alerted early and loudly if your deployments have inadvertent Internet dependencies.</li></ul><div>These new features are documented in the source <a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/blob/develop/docs/index.txt#L280">here</a>. &nbsp;If you want to start using them now, you can fetch a copy of <code>virtualenv.py</code> from the "develop" branch:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/raw/develop/virtualenv.py">https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/raw/develop/virtualenv.py</a></div><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p></p>
