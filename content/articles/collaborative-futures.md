<p>Everything is speeding up these days, even the authoring of books.  Some information society researchers we know (including some of our friends from <a href="http://eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.shiftspace.org/">Shift Space</a>) locked themselves up for a week in Berlin, and came out the other end with a print-ready book on the future of collaboration - <a href="http://www.mandiberg.com/2010/01/25/we-wrote-the-book-collaborative-futures-transmediale-booksprint/">Collaborative Futures</a>. </p>

<p>Even though I didn't travel to Berlin, the authorship of the book was radically distributed and  some of my writing made it into the final cut. A portion of  <a href="http://alchemicalmusings.org/files/essays/versioning_dissonance/versioning_dissonance_jbossewitch.pdf">essay</a> I wrote last fall for a sociology seminar on the future on a (brief) history of version control systems and the significance of distributed version control systems <a href="http://www.booki.cc/collaborativefutures/multiplicity-and-social-coding/">made the cut</a>.</p>

<p>The book will be released under a creative commons license, but they are also doing a print run of hard copies which will be available starting at the launch party, March 4th. Pre-order hard copy <a href="http://www.mandiberg.com/2010/02/02/pre-order-collaborative-futures-now/">here</a> (digital copy is available <a href="http://www.booki.cc/collaborativefutures/">here</a>).</p>
