<p>This semester we partnered with the Earth Institute and launched <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portfolio/political_science_and_social_policy/mdp.html">an environment</a> to support the new international Masters in Development Practice.  The environment is intended to support curricular interactions as well as less formal student interactions (i.e. social networking) and our first iteration is built on a combination of Moodle and Elgg.</p>

<p>We are just dipping into Moodle development and ran into a situation where we wanted to customize the video player we were using to display the video. I ended up writing a small moodle filter which automatically processes .mp4 files and outputs the appropriate embed code.  The code is now available at on github: <a href="http://github.com/ccnmtl/moodle-mp4filter">moodle-mp4filter</a>.</p>
