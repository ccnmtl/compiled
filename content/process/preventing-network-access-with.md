<p>Anders has written <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/compiled/sysadmin/deploying_django_and_deploying.html">several</a> <a href="http://thraxil.org/users/anders/posts/2009/06/12/Django-Deployment-with-virtualenv-and-pip/">times</a> about our deployment strategy for Django apps at <span class="caps">CCNMTL. </span> Aside from containment of each project with <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a>, we also try to make sure that deployments never depend on anything external, and can be done without access to the wider Internet.  We do this by an aggressive form of version pinning: in each project's repository, we check in source tarballs of all the project's dependencies, including Django itself.  We then have a <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/">pip</a> requirements file that points to each of these local files in order.  (<a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/smart_sa/tree/master/requirements">Here's an example</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/smart_sa/blob/master/bootstrap.py">the bootstrap script that uses it</a>.)</p>

<p>There are two benefits to this approach.  First, it removes our deployments' dependencies on external web services, like <a href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>, being online.  Second, it ensures that we know exactly what versions we're using of <b>all</b> the Python code in a project's deployment.  That makes deployments trivially repeatable, and gives us the ability to roll back a deployment to any earlier version -- so if a new deployment doesn't work properly for some reason, we can re-deploy the last tagged deployment and know that (barring system-level changes) it'll work exactly as expected.</p>

<p>The other week, we made a new deployment to one of our Django projects, and the site stopped working.  It turned out that the wrong version of Django was installed somehow: the project was built on Django 1.0, but this broken deployment ended up with Django 1.2 instead.  And, oddly, rolling back to the previous deployment didn't fix the problem.</p>
