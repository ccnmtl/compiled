<p>Last night Sky and I presented <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/compiled/projects/composition_with_video_images.html">MediaThread</a> at a <a href="http://www.djangonyc.org/calendar/13794476/">Django meetup</a> in <span class="caps">NYC.</span> We were invited to give a full presentation after a lighting talk back a few months ago. The event was held at <a href="http://www.hugeinc.com/">Huge</a> with about 20 people attending from a variety of backgrounds. The participants were engaged and involved, asking questions about our implementation, process, and student usage.  We also heard a report back on the European <a href="http://djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon</a> and broke bread (and beer) with local Djangonaughts. </p>
