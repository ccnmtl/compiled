<p>Back in May, Anders attended the <a href="http://ricon.io/east.html">Ricon East</a>, "a distributed systems conference by and for engineers, developers, scientists and architects".  The distributed data-store Riak was featured prominently at the conference but the event was intended more as a conference on distributed systems in general spanning academia and industry.</p>
