<p><a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon '12</a> is on the East Coast this year, and we submitted a proposal to present on our <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/news/announcements/south-africa-trip-informs-hiv-adherence-project.html">recent intervention</a> in South Africa.  We hope to see you in DC!</p>

<p><b>Title:</b> Offline and Off-Road: Django, Health and Human Rights</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> For years, <span class="caps">CCNMTL </span>has been using Django to create interactive multimedia health interventions. We'll spotlight our latest <span class="caps">NIMH</span>-funded project where we deployed Django to offline netbooks at South African <span class="caps">HIV </span>clinics, and developed a sneakernet-based (ie <span class="caps">USB </span>drives) data synchronization protocol. We'll also present our <span class="caps">FOSS CMS </span>for authoring these ebook-like sites.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> For years, <span class="caps">CCNMTL </span>has been using Django to create interactive multimedia health interventions as a part of our <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/triangle">Triangle initiative</a>. We have worked closely with the Schools of Social Work and Public health to explore the possibilities and benefits of incorporating rich, interactive, multimedia into these kinds of counseling sessions.</p>

<p>In this talk we will spotlight <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portfolio/medicine_and_health/masivukeni.html">Masivukeni</a>, our latest <span class="caps">NIMH</span>-funded project where we deployed Django to offline netbooks at South African <span class="caps">HIV </span>clinics, and developed a sneakernet-based (ie <span class="caps">USB </span>drives) data synchronization protocol. </p>

<p>As we iterate over projects like these, we have continued to abstract the aspects of these projects that are idiosyncratic to this domain. We'll also present our open-source <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-pagetree">lightweigth-CMS</a> that we have created for authoring these ebook-like sites. The characteristics of these sites are serial content delivery (often with specific business rules, such as preventing access to already-seen, or not-yet-seen pages), interspersed with casual learning "games" (eg html5/javascript drag and drop activities).</p>

<p>Finally, we will discuss the roadmap for this authoring tool, including the possibility of a networked, collaborative ebook authoring tool, that might export epub3 or <span class="caps">SCORM</span>-compliant sites.</p>
