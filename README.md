CompilED is a collection of reflections and comments by the [software developers](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/authors/) at Columbia's [Center for Teaching and Learning](http://ctl.columbia.edu) (CTL). These views are rooted in our professional and personal experiences developing educational technology. This blog is directed at hackers, programmers, designers, and architects of all flavors, but everyone is welcome.
